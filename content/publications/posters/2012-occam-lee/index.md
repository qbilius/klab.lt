Primary visual cortical activity reduces when sensory input can be perceptually organized as a unified Gestalt.This reduction could offer important insights into the nature of feedback computations within the human visual system, however, the properties of this response reduction have not yet been investigated in detail. Here we replicate this reduced V1 response, but find that the modulation in V1 (and V2/V3) to the perceived organization of the input is not specific to the retinotopic location at which the sensory input from that stimulus is represented. Instead, we find a response modulation that is equally evident across the primary visual cortex. We conclude that, in response to the perception of an organized Gestalt, feedback does not act specifically on the part of the retinotopic map representing the sensory input but effects the responsive of primary visual cortex as a whole.
