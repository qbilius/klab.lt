Successful accumulation of knowledge is critically dependent on the ability to verify and replicate every part of a scientific conduct. However, such principles are difficult to enact when researchers continue to resort on ad hoc workflows resulting in a poorly maintained code base. Based on a critical examination of the needs of neuroscience and psychology community, I introduce psychopy\_ext, a unifying framework that seamlessly integrates experiment building, analysis and manuscript preparation by choosing reasonable defaults and implementing relatively rigid patterns of workflow. This structure allows automation of multiple tasks, such as automatic user interfaces, unit testing, stimulus control analyses, single-command access to descriptive statistics, and publication quality plotting. Taken together, psychopy\_ext opens an exciting possibility for faster, more robust code development and collaboration for researchers.
