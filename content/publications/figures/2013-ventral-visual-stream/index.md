This figure is inspired by [DiCarlo & Cox (2007)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2007.06.010) beautiful representation of transformations occurring in the ventral visual stream. Note that this is only a cartoon version of processing occutring in the visual system. In particular, whether objects are recognized in LOC is debatable.
