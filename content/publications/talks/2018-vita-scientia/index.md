I will discuss how deep learning is accelerating our understanding of human intelligence. How can we use powerful machine learning techniques to investigate information processing mechanisms in the brain? And how neuroscience can meaningfully inform artificial intelligence research? Focusing on one aspect of perceptual intelligence – human object recognition – I will describe the history and our current efforts to build, evolve, and train brain-like models that account for human behavior in this task and capture neural responses in the primate visual cortex.
