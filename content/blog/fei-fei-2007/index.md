**Time course in general:**

-   Scene categorization and action type already available at 107 ms.
-   Bias to outdoor classificasions with shorter durations but little confusion between manmade outdoor and natural outdoor. This bias is not linked to differential time courses of low-level, sensory information or in object recognition. **Open question:** Are some discriminative features missing?
-   Weak but signifcant correlation between object and scene recognition up till 107 ms. Driven primarily by a strong correlation between inanimate object and scene perception from 40 ms on, but little correlation between animate object and scene perception. **Conclusion:** object and scene processing share some resources.

**Superordinate (e.g., inanimate natural object, indoor) versus basic-level processing (rock, office):**

-   No clear faster processing of basic-level object categories versus superordinate categories (in conflict with Rosch, 1978).
-   At 27 ms, there is a slight advantage in perceiving an animate object.
-   Evidence for an object hierarchy: coarser level object categorization precedes finer grain recognition.
-   No evidence for a scene hierarchy: superordinate-level categorization requires as much information as basic level.

**Sensory versus semantic information:**

-   Sensory information dominates over semantic object and outdoor scene information until 53 ms; for indoor scenes, until 80 ms (in conflict with Grill-Spector & Kanwisher, 2005). Object information becomes dominant earlier than scene. **Conclusion:** “shape-related information has a slight advantage over semantically meaningful information of a scene”.
