Conducting research in psychology and science in general are undergoing vast changes. Web-based technologies enabled acquisition of massive datasets with thousands of participants. The data, code, and any other research output can also be shared easily online. These advances are breaking the traditional publication model and this lecture will bring you to the forefront of this revolution. We will describe available technologies, discuss their advantages and weaknesses, and try to understand how to proceed in practice.
